# __HashMap and HashSet README__
## __Introduction__
Welcome to the HashMap and HashSet README! This document provides an overview of HashMap and HashSet, two essential data structures in computer science. Both are part of the Java Collections Framework and are widely used for efficient data storage and retrieval.
## __HashMap__
### __What is HashMap?__
HashMap is a data structure that implements the Map interface in Java. It stores key-value pairs and allows rapid retrieval of values based on their associated keys. It uses a hash table to achieve constant-time complexity for basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and lookup.

### __Key Features__
Key-Value Pairs: HashMap stores data in the form of key-value pairs, where each key is unique.

Hashing: It uses a hashing mechanism to convert keys into indices, facilitating fast data retrieval.

Dynamic Sizing: HashMap dynamically adjusts its size to accommodate the number of elements it contains, ensuring efficient memory usage.

Null Values: It allows one null key and multiple null values.
### __Usage Example__
// Creating a HashMap
HashMap<String, Integer> hashMap = new HashMap<>();

// Adding key-value pairs
hashMap.put("One", 1);
hashMap.put("Two", 2);
hashMap.put("Three", 3);

// Retrieving values
int value = hashMap.get("Two");
System.out.println("Value associated with key 'Two': " + value);

## __HashSet__
### __What is HashSet?__
HashSet is a collection that implements the Set interface in Java. It uses a hash table to store unique elements and ensures that no duplicate elements are present in the collection. HashSet is particularly useful when the order of elements is not important, and you need fast access to unique values.

### __Key Features__
Uniqueness: HashSet does not allow duplicate elements, ensuring that each element is unique.

Hashing Mechanism: Similar to HashMap, HashSet uses hashing to achieve constant-time complexity for basic operations.

No Order Guarantee: The order of elements in a HashSet is not guaranteed, and it may change over time.

Null Element: HashSet allows a single null element.

### __Usage Example__
// Creating a HashSet
HashSet<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>();

// Adding elements
hashSet.add("Apple");
hashSet.add("Banana");
hashSet.add("Orange");

// Checking for existence
boolean containsOrange = hashSet.contains("Orange");
System.out.println("Contains Orange: " + containsOrange);

### __HashMap Time Complexity:__
__Insertion (put operation)__: O(1) on average. In the average case, inserting a key-value pair into a HashMap takes constant time. However, in the worst case, when there are hash collisions, it can degrade to O(n) due to linked list traversal (but improvements like balanced trees in modern HashMap implementations mitigate this).

__Retrieval (get operation)__: O(1) on average. Similar to insertion, the average time complexity for retrieving a value based on a key is constant. However, in the worst case, it can also be O(n) due to hash collisions.

__Deletion (remove operation)__: O(1) on average. Like insertion and retrieval, removing a key-value pair has constant average time complexity but can be O(n) in the worst case.

### __HashSet Time Complexity__:
__Insertion (add operation)__: O(1) on average. HashSet uses a HashMap internally, and the average time complexity for inserting an element is constant.

__Retrieval (contains operation)__: O(1) on average. Similar to insertion, the average time complexity for checking if an element exists is constant.

__Deletion (remove operation)__: O(1) on average. The average time complexity for removing an element is constant.

## __Conclusion__
HashMap and HashSet are versatile data structures that provide efficient means of storing and retrieving data. Understanding their features and usage can greatly enhance your ability to work with collections in Java. Feel free to explore their methods and integrate them into your projects for optimized data management.
